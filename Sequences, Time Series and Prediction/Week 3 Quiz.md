- [ ] Changes the shape of the input or output data

#### 4. What does the axis parameter of tf.expand_dims do?

- [ ] Defines if the tensor is X or Y
- [x] `Defines the dimension index at which you will expand the shape of the tensor`
- [ ] Defines the axis around which to expand the dimensions
- [ ] Defines the dimension index to remove when you expand the tensor
